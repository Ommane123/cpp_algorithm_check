    // the rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size == Time Complexity
    // UNIT OF TIME COMPLEXITY == Big O
    // Rules :
    //      1. Tell worst case scenario
    /*      2. Avoid constants
            3. Avoid lower values

            e.g. - O(n^15 + n^10 + 3) here,   3 == constant
                                              n^10 == lower constant
            here we are gonna tell n^15 cause its the biggest value...

            Time limit = 1s(second) = 10^8 in interview or in questions they might ask if its 3s = 3*10^8 or if 5s = 5*10^8


Space Complexity :
        Neverever manipulate input data
        like, a = 5; b = 6;
                b = a + b; this is wrong
